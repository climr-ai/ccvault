"""SRD spell data for D&D 5e.

This module contains a subset of spells from the System Reference Document (SRD)
which are available under the Open Gaming License.

Spells default to 2024 rules. Use the `variants` field for ruleset-specific
overrides (e.g., 2014 rules). Call `for_ruleset()` to get the spell with
the appropriate variant applied.

Note: This file is intentionally large (~7,500 lines) to keep all spell data
in one place with Python dataclass definitions. This approach provides:
- IDE type checking and autocomplete support
- Fast import (no runtime JSON/YAML parsing)
- Dataclass methods available directly on spell instances
- Single source of truth for spell data

Structure:
- Lines 1-160: Dataclass definitions (Spell, SpellVariant)
- Lines 160-970: Cantrips (CANTRIPS list)
- Lines 970-2080: 1st Level Spells
- Lines 2080-3290: 2nd Level Spells
- Lines 3290-4300: 3rd Level Spells
- Lines 4300-5030: 4th Level Spells
- Lines 5030-5940: 5th Level Spells
